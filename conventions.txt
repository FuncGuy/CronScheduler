Generic term "time" is used throughout this project to refer to instant/current/unix time, not wall
clock time. Wall clock time could be referred as "wall time" or "clock time", but not just "time".
The exception is the naming of "scheduleAtRoundTimesInDay" methods, where the wall clock time is
meant, but neither "clock" nor "wall" appears; "InDay" part is meant to convey the wall clock time
meaning.

Clock concept is tied to time zones; "clock" term is avoided when time zones are not an immediate
concern. The exception is the "clock drift" term because it is widely used and known, although it's
not actually about clock drift, but rather about time drift, in this project's terms.

Time jumps are referred as "shifts", clock jumps are referred as "changes". Other terms like "jump"
or "cutover" are avoided.
